Docstring:
 are a way for us to create little bits of documentation as we are coding along in our functions or in our other blocks of code
 the docstring has to go as the first line after function definition
 and it should be between """ """
 and could be multi line
 eg. def func_name():
    """ this is a docstring """
    //function definition
