1. Try to understand and describe the problem
2. Replicate / reproduce the bug. If we cant reproduce then it becomes a difficult bug. When does it happen and then we try to fix it
3. Play computer and evaluate each line
4. Fixing errors and watch for the red lines
5. try using print() statements in between 
6. Use a debugger

8. Ask a friend
9. Run your code often, once you change it slightly try and run it and tackle it one at a time
