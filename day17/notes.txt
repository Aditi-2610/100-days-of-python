class Car:
    ""class keyword
    ""indented 
    pass
    use pass if you dont want to pass through the class, or keep an empty class


user1 = Car() <- object creation 

The name of class should have PascalCase
snake_case for everything else

attribute creation:
user1.id = "001"
user1.username = "angela"

print(user1.username) 

Constructor: is a part of the blue print that 
allows us to specify what should happen when our obj 
is being constructed
initialize by using a special function:
__init__

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
    called everytime you make a new object of this class

    def __init__(self,seats):
        self.seats = seats

my_car = Car(5)

Method:
when a function is attached to an object, it is called a methid
A method should always have the first parameter as self, so it know the object that calls it
    class Car:
        def enter_race_mode(self, user);
            self.seats = 2

    Car.enter_race_mode()
